# Introduction to Programming and Computational Thinking

These are lesson notes for an introduction to programming course taught at [Spark](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Spark/) 2016 using IPython notebooks. The notebooks are partially adapted and modified from several sources, particularly [Exploratory Computing with Python](https://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/), an online tutorial developed by Mark Bakker.

You can download the notebooks by selecting "Download ZIP" above, and run them after you install Python and the appropriate packages. The easiest way to do this is to install an installer that includes Python and a set of the most popular packages. The recommended installer is [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Get the installer for Python 3.X. After installing Anaconda, start the Launcher and then launch the ipython-notebook, which will open the ipython-notebook dashboard in your webbrowser. Use the dashboard to surf to the directory where you stored your Notebooks and click on the one you want to open.
