In the example given below, `mylist` contains 5 *things*: the integer 1, the floating-point number 20, the word `python`, a list with the values 1,2,3, and finally, the function `len`. The latter means that `mylist[4]` is actually the function `len`. That function can be called to determine the length of a list as shown below. The latter may be a bit confusing, but it is cool behavior if you take the time to think about it."
